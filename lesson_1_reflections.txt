How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    When I changed something on my codes,it maybe causes some mistakes.Maybe I pressed some keys on the keyboard,or I make some spelling mistakes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's easy to help me or others to read the source code.It will tell us what and when caused the bug.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Cons: you may lose your job in case of an emergency
    Advantages: whether to save under your own control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs only handles one file at a time. While Git may be a need to save the program, for example, changes in one class in Java involve changes to other classes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know now.But I will konw later.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Make a backup before I change it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Make a backup.
